# O-List e-commerce Dataset Analysis
## Generation UK&I Final Project

### Tasks:

Work in groups to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset, a demo dataset maintained by Microsoft.
Use SQL, Python, and data analytics to investigate the dataset and answer these questions: 

- What are the regional sales in the best-performing country?
- What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
- What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
- What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title?
- What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
- What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?

Answer these questions in a concise, informative, and accurately worded PowerPoint presentation that includes charts to support your findings. 
Also produce a written report that summarises all the information in the PowerPoint presentation within a Python Jupiter Notebook.
